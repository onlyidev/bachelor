    (MalGAN)
        Adversarial attack generation
            Needs binary feature vectors
    (MCA - Multiple Correspondance Analysis)
        Reduce dimensionality by clustering
            Make sense of the data
    (LIME - Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
        Can only process text/image/tabular data
        Needs to be trained on the same dataset as the model we are trying to explain
        {{Has different modes}}
    ember)EMBER(
```

## Notes

### LIME

- Detector and LIME need to be trained on the same dataset together (EMBER)
- LIME needs different features than the detector (processed by MCA)
